External Applications
=====================

In addition to the features included in ``django-taggit`` directly, there are a
number of external applications which provide additional features that may be
of interest.

.. note::

    Despite their mention here, the following applications are in no way
    official, nor have they in any way been reviewed or tested.


If you have an application that you'd like to see listed here, simply fork
``taggit`` on `github`__, add it to this list, and send a pull request.

 * ``django-taggit-suggest``: Provides support for defining keyword and regular
   expression rules for suggesting new tags for content.  This used to be
   available at ``taggit.contrib.suggest``.  Available on `github`__.
 * ``django-taggit-templatetags``: Provides several templatetags, including one
   for tag clouds, to expose various ``taggit`` APIs directly to templates.
   Available on `github`__.
