Description: django-autoslug
        ===============
        
        Django-autoslug is a reusable Django application that provides an improved
        slug field which can automatically:
        
        a) populate itself from another field,
        b) preserve uniqueness of the value and
        c) use custom `slugify()` functions for better i18n.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        A simple example::
        
            from django.db.models import CharField, Model
            from autoslug import AutoSlugField
        
            class Article(Model):
                title = CharField(max_length=200)
                slug = AutoSlugField(populate_from='title')
        
        More complex example::
        
            from django.db.models import CharField, DateField, ForeignKey, Model
            from django.contrib.auth.models import User
            from autoslug import AutoSlugField
        
            class Article(Model):
                title = CharField(max_length=200)
                pub_date = DateField(auto_now_add=True)
                author = ForeignKey(User)
                slug = AutoSlugField(populate_from=lambda instance: instance.title,
                                     unique_with=['author__name', 'pub_date__month'],
                                     slugify=lambda value: value.replace(' ','-'))
